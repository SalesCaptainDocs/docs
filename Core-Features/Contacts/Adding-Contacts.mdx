## **How to Add Contacts in SalesCaptain**

### **1. Manually Adding a Contact**

For adding information one individual at a time:

- Go to the **Contacts** tab in your sidebar.
- Click **Add Contact**.
- Enter the contact’s **Name**, **Number**, and **Email**. _(SalesCaptain treats the name as a single field, so enter first and last name together.)_
- Toggle **Email Opt-In** and **Text Opt-In** as needed to ensure compliance.
- While typing, SalesCaptain automatically checks if the contact already exists to prevent duplicates.
- Add **Custom Fields** (e.g. vehicle type, purchase date, or purchase amount) to better segment campaigns. You can define the field type (date, number, currency, etc.) when creating it.
- Apply **Tags** to identify special attributes such as “Customers redirected from another platform.” Each contact can hold multiple tags.

These shortcuts let you build your contact database organically while you’re already engaging with leads.

#### **2. Importing Contacts**

If you have a large list of contacts, import them in bulk through a CSV file:

- Make sure the required fields (Name, Email, Number) are included and consistent.
- While importing, map your columns to SalesCaptain’s fields, including any custom fields you’ve created.
- Apply tags during import to segment the list immediately.
