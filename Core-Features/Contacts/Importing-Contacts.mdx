## **Before You Upload**

Prepare your CSV file so the import goes smoothly:

- Combine **first and last name** into a single column labeled “Name” to match SalesCaptain’s field format.
- Make sure your CSV includes at least a **Name** and **Phone Number**.
- Optional: include **Email**, **Opt-in Status**, and any **Tags** as extra columns for richer data.

## **Upload & Map Fields**

Once your file is ready, importing takes just a few steps:

1. Go to the **Contacts** tab and select **Options** before clicking on **Upload CSV**.

## **Best Practices**

- Double-check your CSV formatting before uploading to avoid errors.
- Pre-create any custom fields you know you’ll need.
- Use tags during import to track the source or group of each list.
- Test with a small file first if you’re unsure about your mapping.
