title: "Voicemail"
description: "Voicemail is an element of incoming call flow building that captures recorded messages when no one is available to take the call. This could occur when agents are all busy, after a call has rung to your team or user without a response, or during hours when you’ve configured your flow to route calls to voicemail. "

### **Why Voicemail Matters**

- Ensures you never miss a call — even during busy times or when no agent is available.
- Supports follow-up actions and automation (e.g. send an SMS follow-up after voicemail).
- Adds professionalism: callers receive a greeting, know that you acknowledge their attempt.
- Flexible: works in combination with other elements like Time Rules and IVR.

### **How to Configure Voicemail in a Call Flow**

1. **Add the Voicemail element** from the right-side panel into your incoming call flow at the point where you want voicemail to occur.
2. **Configure the greeting**: Upload MP3 or use the inbuilt text-to-speech ability. Tailor it to indicate why caller is in voicemail (after hours / no agents / queue timeout).

3. **Decide routing logic**: What happens before voicemail triggers (e.g. Ring to User or Team block times out), whether the call is during After-Hours (via Profile Time Rules or Custom Time Rules).
4. **Set post-voicemail follow-ups**: e.g., send SMS to the caller (using the “Send SMS” element), send the recording/transcription internally.

### **Best Practices**

- Use a clear, concise greeting with a friendly tone.
- Let callers know approximate time you'll return their call.
- Use Voicemail in flows strategically: combine with Time Rules so voicemail is used only when needed (after hours, or when agents unavailable).
- Include follow-up automation (SMS or internal alert) so voice messages are actioned in a timely manner.
- Test the voicemail branch in your flow: ensure greeting plays correctly, message is recorded and delivered.
