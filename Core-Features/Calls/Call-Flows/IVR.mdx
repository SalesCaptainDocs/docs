## Why IVR Menus Matter

An IVR menu is often the first interaction your caller has with your business. A clear, professional menu:

- Lets callers quickly choose the right department or service
- Reduces the need for manual call transfers
- Filters out spam and unwanted calls
- Keeps after-hours or high-volume periods manageable

## Adding IVR Menus to a Call Flow

Setting up an IVR menu in SalesCaptain is simple:

1. In the **Call Flows** editor, drag the **IVR Menu** element from the right-hand panel into your workspace.

2. Add a greeting or menu prompt. For example: “Press 1 for Sales, Press 2 for Support.” You can upload a prerecorded message or type text for our text-to-speech engine.

   You can also enable automatic announcement of the menu options, or disable it if your audio or text already includes them.
3. Define your menu options. For each number pressed, you can route the caller to another branch in your flow, a specific agent or team, voicemail, or even an AI Agent.

## Best Practices

- **Keep menus short and clear.** Too many options can confuse callers. Keeping the choices simple still allows for filtering callers and directing them to the right place without overwhelming them.
- **Use IVR to pre-qualify or filter.** For example, send “Press 9” to reach an AI Agent or voicemail after hours.
- **Combine with Time Rules.** Route menu options differently during business hours vs. after hours for a seamless experience.
