title: "Audio Message"
description: "Audio Message elements let you play pre-recorded or dynamically generated messages (via text-to-speech or uploaded MP3) to the caller at specific points during an incoming call. This could be a greeting, an announcement, or any audio you want to present before further routing or action."

### **Why Audio Messages Matter**

- Creates a more polished, branded caller experience.
- Can communicate useful info (e.g. “We may record this call for training purposes”, “Due to high volume there may be a wait”, etc.).
- Helps set expectations, reduce frustration, and guide callers correctly.
- Works well before other steps such as IVR, Ring to User/Team, or even before sending callers to voicemail.

### **How to Configure Audio Messages in a Call Flow**

1. **Add the Audio Message element** into your Canvas at the desired point.
2. **Choose message type**: upload an MP3 file or use text-to-speech.

3. **Determine when to play**: immediately after incoming call, before IVR, before transfer to agent/team, etc.
4. **Define what happens after the audio**: route to IVR, ring to user/team, or a fallback like voicemail or escalation.

### **Best Practices**

- Keep audio messages short and focused. Overly long messages can frustrate callers.
- Use high quality audio (for MP3 versions) to maintain clarity and reduce misunderstandings.
- Ensure the tone and content of the message aligns with your overall brand.
- Use audio to clarify service hours, whether calls are recorded, expected wait times, etc.
