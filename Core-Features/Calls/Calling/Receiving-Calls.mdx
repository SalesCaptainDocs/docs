## Incoming Call Routing

Call Flows let you decide exactly where an incoming call should go. For full setup instructions, check out our [Call Flows guide](/Core-Features/Calls/Call-Flows/Creating-Call-Flows).

You can choose from three main [routing ](Core-Features/Calls/Call-Flows/After-Hours-Routing)options:

### Ring to User

- Send an incoming call directly to a specific team member inside SalesCaptain. 
- If they have the desktop or mobile app, they’ll receive calls directed to them in real time.

### Ring to Team

- Alert all members of a designated team (such as Sales or Support) at once.
- Combine this with IVR menus or time rules to ensure new queries reach the right people quickly.

### Forward

- Transfer an incoming call to any phone number (internal or external). Just enter the number you’d like to ring — even if it’s outside SalesCaptain.

## Answering Calls

Calls ring simultaneously on all your connected devices.

### On Desktop or Web

Tap the incoming call notification to accept. Use the transfer icon to send the call to another user, group, or hardphone.

## Call Controls

Once you’re on the line, SalesCaptain gives you full control over the call experience:

### Hold & Resume

Place participants on hold with a single click and resume when ready. Perfect for checking details or moving between calls.

### Transfer Options

Move the call to another user, hardphone, group, or contact. Choose between a [**direct transfer**](Core-Features/Calls/Call-Transfers/Direct-Transfers) (send the call immediately) or a [**warm transfer**](Core-Features/Calls/Call-Transfers/Warm-Transfers) (speak to the recipient first).

You can even attach a quick message before transferring. Learn more about call transfers here.

### Keypad Access

Open the keypad to dial menu options or enter account numbers without leaving the call.

### Coaching & Monitoring

If a teammate is on a call, you can join, coach privately, or monitor with real-time AI transcription — especially useful for onboarding or support escalation.

This expanded toolkit ensures you can manage calls seamlessly without juggling multiple apps or devices.

## If You Miss a Call

Even when you’re unavailable, SalesCaptain keeps you covered:

- [**After-hours routing**](https://salescaptain-42c66529.mintlify.app/Core-Features/Calls/Call-Flows/After-Hours-Routing) to voicemail, an AI agent, or another number
- [**Voicemail-to-text**](Core-Features/Calls/Call-Flows/Voicemail) so you can review messages instantly
- **AI Phone Agent** available 24/7 to answer questions or take bookings

You’ll also receive instant notifications about missed calls, so you can follow up quickly.

  **_Tip:_** Set up time-based routing so calls after hours are handled by voicemail or AI, ensuring no lead slips through the cracks.
