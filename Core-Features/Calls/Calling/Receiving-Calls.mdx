## Incoming Call Routing

Call Flows let you decide exactly where an incoming call should go. For full setup instructions, check out our <u>Call Flows guide</u>.

You can choose from three main routing options:

### Ring to User

- Send an incoming call directly to a specific team member inside SalesCaptain. 
- If they have the desktop or mobile app, they’ll receive calls directed to them in real time.\

### Ring to Team

- Alert all members of a designated team (such as Sales or Support) at once.
- Combine this with IVR menus or time rules to ensure new queries reach the right people quickly.\

### Forward

- Transfer an incoming call to any phone number (internal or external). Just enter the number you’d like to ring — even if it’s outside SalesCaptain.\

## Answering Calls

### Transfer Options

Move the call to another user, hardphone, group, or contact. Choose between a **direct transfer** (send the call immediately) or a **warm transfer** (speak to the recipient first). You can even attach a quick message before transferring. Learn more about <u>call transfers here. </u>\

### Participant Management

Drop participants from the call or add someone new with **conference calling** — ideal for looping in another team member or expert.\

### Coaching & Monitoring

If a teammate is on a call, you can join, coach privately, or monitor with real-time AI transcription — especially useful for onboarding or support escalation.\
