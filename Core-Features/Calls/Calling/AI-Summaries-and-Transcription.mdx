## **How Can They Help Me?**

### **Transcription**

Transcription means converting the entire call audio into text, usually in real time or shortly after the call. This gives you:

- A complete record of everything said, reducing miscommunication or forgotten details
- An easily accessible text log to quickly find the moment something was mentioned
- Clear distinction of speakers (agent vs customer) to help with clarity
- Reference for coaching, compliance, or legal needs

### **Summary**

A summary pulls out the key parts of the transcription: what was important, what action items came up, what next steps are. It helps you:

- Save time by avoiding having to listen to the entire call recording or skip back and forth to find the information that you need.
- Capture the essentials: decisions, next steps, customer concerns or objections
- Share concise notes internally or with customer
- Ensure follow-ups happen based on what was discussed

## **How Call Summaries & Transcriptions Work in SalesCaptain**

1. **Call Begins**\
   When you make or receive a call, the system starts recording automatically. 
2. **Transcription Generation**\
   During the call, the audio is transcribed into text in real time. This text is accessible any time from the call details in your inbox or the call log.

3. **Summary Creation**\
   Once transcription is ready, a summary is generated from the data. It highlights:
   - Key discussion points
   - Customer concerns or objections
   - Any commitments made (e.g. “Send pricing”, “Schedule a demo”)
   - Next steps for both sides

4. **Use in Follow-up & Analytics**
   - Using the transcript & summary to plan follow-ups (emails, tasks)
   - Managers reviewing several summaries to spot recurring issues or training needs
   - Use data for improving messaging, scripts or product feedback

## **Best Practices & Tips**

- Always ensure you inform the caller (if required) before recording/transcribing.
- Train agents to speak clearly and identify themselves to help with speaker separation.
- Use the summary to assign clear next steps immediately after each call.
- Regularly review summaries to look for patterns in objections or customer feedback—it can help refine product or messaging.
- For long calls, it may help to mark “key moments” (e.g. “pricing discussed”, “next meeting scheduled”) manually or via UI to make navigation easier.
