## **How Warm Transfers Work**

While you’re on an active call, tap the **Transfer** icon in your call controls. Choose the teammate, team, or external number you want to reach. SalesCaptain will put your caller on hold while you speak privately with the recipient first.

Once the recipient confirms they’re ready, you can complete the transfer with a single click. If needed, you can also add a quick note so the recipient sees context immediately.
