Looking for the fastest way to move a caller without speaking to the recipient first? Check out our [Direct Transfers](Core-Features/Calls/Call-Transfers/Direct-Transfers) guide instead.

## **How Warm Transfers Work**

While you’re on an active call, tap the **Transfer** icon in your call controls. Choose the teammate, team, or external number you want to reach. SalesCaptain will put your caller on hold while you speak privately with the recipient first.

Once the recipient confirms they’re ready, you can complete the transfer with a single click. If needed, you can also add a quick note so the recipient sees context immediately.

**When to Use Warm Transfers**

- Escalating a support issue with background info
- Introducing a lead to an account manager
- Making sure a specialist is available before connecting the caller

Warm transfers help your team deliver smoother, more personal customer experiences without losing context.
