title: "Direct Transfers"
description: "Cold transfers (also called blind or direct transfers) move a live caller immediately to another number or user, while simultaneously removing you from the call. They’re ideal for quick, efficient hand-offs."

Need to brief the recipient before handing the call off? See our <u>Warm Transfers</u> guide for that option.

## **How Direct Transfers Work**

While on a call, tap the **Transfer** icon. Select the teammate, team, or external number you want, then choose **Direct Transfer**. The call will move instantly, and you’re off the line.

Because direct transfers skip the “warm-up” step, they’re the fastest way to redirect a caller.

## **When to Use Direct Transfers**

- Sending routine calls to the right department
- Quickly routing after-hours calls to voicemail or an AI agent
- Offloading calls to an external answering service

Direct transfers make sure your callers reach the right destination fast, with minimal steps for your team.
