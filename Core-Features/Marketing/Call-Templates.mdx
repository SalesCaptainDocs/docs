## **Navigating to Call Templates**

1. From the sidebar, go to **Marketing → Templates**.
2. Click **Create Template**.
3. Select **Call** as the template type.
4. Choose **Custom** to begin building your call.

## **Overview**

The **Custom Call Template** lets you create automated voice calls that play a personalized message and capture customer responses through keypad inputs.

You can either **upload your own audio recording** or use the built-in **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** feature to generate messages from text.

Each keypress (DTMF) can be assigned to a specific action, such as recording feedback, sending an SMS, or transferring the caller to a live agent.

This flexibility makes it ideal for automating interactions like **feedback collection, payment reminders, review requests, and appointment confirmations**, saving time while ensuring consistent and professional communication.

### **Call Setup**

- Enter a descriptive **title** for your Call Template so it’s easy to identify later.
- Choose the **Caller ID**, which determines the number shown on the recipient’s phone.
- For the **Audio Message**, type your message using TTS.

### **Writing the Message**

- Keep your message short, friendly, and clear — ideally under 30 seconds.
- Use **personalization tokens** such as @first_name or @business_name to make each call feel natural and relevant.
- Maintain a conversational tone that reflects your brand voice.

### **Assigning Key Inputs (DTMF)**

Define what happens when a customer presses each key during the call.

These inputs ensure smooth, guided interactions and provide convenience for both your team and customers.

## **Example Use Cases**

### **Review Request Call**

- Use this to automatically gather customer reviews and feedback.
- Positive responses can trigger a review link, while negative ones can collect private feedback for follow-up.
- Ideal for improving reputation management and customer satisfaction.

### **Appointment Confirmation**

- Automate confirmations, reschedules, and cancellations without manual follow-ups.
- Helps service-based businesses reduce no-shows and maintain organized schedules.

### **Payment Reminder**

- Send polite automated payment reminders for upcoming or overdue invoices.
- Helps ensure timely payments and reduces manual collection efforts.

Each of these can be saved as a separate **Custom Call Template**, allowing quick reuse for future campaigns.

## **Testing & Activation**

- **Test** your template before using it in a live campaign.
- Send a **test call** to verify that the audio plays correctly and that all key inputs trigger the intended actions.
- Check **audio clarity** and confirm that each keypress is mapped properly.
- **Save and publish** the template for future use.

Templates can be attached to **marketing campaigns** or triggered alongside **emails and SMS** from the <u>unified inbox</u> for seamless multi-channel communication.

## **Tips & Best Practices**

- Keep calls **short, friendly, and conversational**.
- State your **business name** at the start of each call.
- Always include a clear **call-to-action** (e.g., “Press 1 to confirm”).
- **Test before activation** to ensure correct key routing and playback quality.
