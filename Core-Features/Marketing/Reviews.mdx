### **Connect Your Google My Business Account**

To get started:

1. Navigate to Settings - Integration 
2. Click **Connect Google My Business Profile** and follow the prompts to link your account. 

Once connected, all your Google reviews will automatically appear inside the **Reviews **tab for quick access and management.

### **View and Manage Reviews**

Download the **Reviews **app from the SalesCaptain **Marketplace.** Once installed, it will appear as a tab in your sidebar.

After integration, you’ll see a complete list of your Google reviews, including:

- Customer name and rating
- Review text
- Source (Google or direct feedback)\
   You can reply manually, filter reviews by source or rating, and monitor overall sentiment.

### **Automate Responses with AI**

SalesCaptain’s AI assistant can automatically respond to new reviews — helping you maintain quick and consistent communication with customers.

1. Go to **AI Settings** within the Reviews tab.
2. Enable **Auto-Respond to Reviews**.
3. Add your **custom instructions** for how the AI should reply (for example, thank positive reviewers or offer support for negative feedback).

### **Create Response Rules**

You can fine-tune when and how AI replies by setting custom rules, such as:

- **Rating:** Only respond to 4–5 star reviews, or follow up on 1–2 star feedback.
- **Source:** Choose to respond only to Google reviews or to all direct feedback.
- **Delay:** Add a delay (e.g., respond after 1 hour or 1 day) to make responses feel more natural.
- **Review Text:** Trigger specific responses when certain keywords appear.

Once set, SalesCaptain will automatically check new reviews against your rules and send a fitting response on your behalf.
