### **Creating a New Campaign**

To start a campaign:

1. Navigate to**Marketing - Campaigns**  tab in your SalesCaptain dashboard.
2. Click **Create New Campaign**.
3. Define the name and use case for your campaign, to keep them organized.
4. Select your recipients — you can choose from saved contact lists, apply filters, or use tags to segment your audience.
5. Choose a message template, or create a new one directly in the composer.

SalesCaptain automatically shortens links using a [**scap.link**](http://scap.link) format, allowing you to track click performance and view detailed analytics later. You can also include your **organization prefix** and **unsubscribe instructions** to stay compliant with SMS marketing regulations.

### **Adding Filters and Conditions**

Use filters to target your campaign precisely:

- Click **Add Filter** to segment your audience using **tags** or **contact attributes**.
- Add conditional logic with **IF/ELSE** rules. For example:
  - _If_ a contact has purchased before → send “thank you” message.
  - _Else_ → send promotional offer.

When a condition is true, SalesCaptain executes the selected action. If it’s false, it either takes the alternate path or skips that step entirely.

### **Scheduling and Timing**

You can configure your campaign’s schedule to:

- **Send immediately**, or
- **Schedule for a specific date and time**

If your contact list exceeds **1,600 recipients**, SalesCaptain automatically distributes the messages in batches over time to ensure reliable delivery and compliance.

You can also set **delays** between messages or conditions if you’re building multi-step campaign sequences.

### **A/B Testing **

Test different versions of your campaigns to optimize results.\
 With A/B testing, you can:

- Split your audience into two or more groups
- Send different versions of the same campaign (e.g., different offers or wording)
- Compare engagement and conversion metrics to identify what works best

### **Campaign Management**

Once your campaign is active, it will appear under one of three states:

- **Scheduled:** Campaign is ready to launch at the configured time.
- **In Progress / Completed:** Campaign has been sent to all recipients.
- **Paused or Draft:** Campaign setup saved but not yet running.

You can **view detailed stats** for each campaign, including:

- Delivery rates
- Click-through data (from [scap.link](http://scap.link) tracking)
- Message credits used
- Audience engagement

Campaigns can also be **duplicated** for quick reuse or editing in future runs.
