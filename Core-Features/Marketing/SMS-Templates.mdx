## **Navigating to SMS Templates**

1. From the sidebar, go to **Marketing → Templates**.
2. Click **Create Template**.
3. Choose from four template types: **Custom**, **Review Request**, **Referral**, or **Customer Experience**.

## **Custom**

The **Custom** template lets you create your own personalized messages for customer service, promotions, or announcements.

- Supports **personalization tokens** (e.g., customer name, date, or other details) to add a personal touch.
- You can include **links** such as Google Review URLs to collect feedback or boost engagement.
- Ideal for quick, direct communication that doesn’t require a structured workflow.

## **Review Request**

The **Review Request** template makes it easy to collect customer reviews while keeping negative feedback private.

1. **Review Request Text**: Write your SMS message inviting customers to share their experience. This message includes an automatically generated review link.
2. **Landing Page**: When customers click the link, they’re taken to a branded landing page where they rate their experience.
   - **Positive ratings** (4–5 stars) are automatically directed to your Google Business Review page.
   - **Negative ratings** (1–3 stars) are routed to a private feedback form instead.
3. **Feedback Form**: The private form is fully editable and allows customers to leave detailed comments. All responses are delivered directly to your SalesCaptain inbox for review.
4. **Thank You Popup**: After submission, customers see a customizable confirmation message thanking them for their feedback.

## **Referral**

The **Referral** template drives word-of-mouth growth through shareable referral links.

1. **Referral Request Text**: Create your invite message encouraging customers to share your business with friends.
2. **Referral Page**: When customers click the link, they’re directed to a page that automatically generates a **unique, shareable referral link**, with options to send it via SMS or email.
3. **Text Referral Form**: Customers can input their friends’ details directly through a simple text-based form.
4. **Email Referral Form**: Alternatively, customers can fill out an email form optimized for desktop users.
5. **Thank You Page**: After submitting, customers see a thank-you message confirming their referral has been recorded.

Track performance through built-in tabs:

- **Sent:** Requests sent to customers.
- **Shared:** Customers who shared their link.
- **Received:** New leads generated from referrals.

 This gives you full visibility into referral activity and ensures no lead is missed.

## **Customer Experience**

The **Customer Experience** template helps you gather actionable insights and guide customers based on their satisfaction.

1. **Feedback Request Text**: Compose the initial SMS message that invites your customer to provide feedback on their recent experience. Include personalization tokens like `@contact.name` or `@business.name` to make the message feel personal.
2. **CX Rating Page**: Configure the rating page your customer will see when they click the link. You can select the rating system that fits your needs:
   - NPS (Net Promoter Score)
   - Star ratings
   - Emoji-based satisfaction scale
3. **Positive Path**: Define the action for customers who give positive ratings. Typically, these customers are directed to leave an online **review** to boost your public reputation.
4. **Negative Path**: Define the action for customers who provide lower ratings. These responses are routed to a **private feedback form**, allowing you to capture constructive input.
5. **Thank You Page**: Customize the final confirmation page that customers see after submitting their feedback. This closing message acknowledges their input and reinforces a positive brand experience.

- Use **tokens** to personalize each message.
- **Test templates** before sending them live.
