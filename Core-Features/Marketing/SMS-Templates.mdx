- You can include **links** such as Google Review URLs to collect feedback or boost engagement.
- Ideal for quick, direct communication that doesn’t require a structured workflow.

Track performance through built-in tabs:

- **Sent:** Requests sent to customers.
- **Shared:** Customers who shared their link.
- **Received:** New leads generated from referrals.

 Once you create a referral template, you can track and manage your requests throught the [Referrals](/Marketplace-and-Integrations/Applications/Referrals) app installed from the SalesCaptain marketplace. This gives you full visibility into referral activity and ensures no lead is missed.

## **Customer Experience**

The **Customer Experience** template helps you gather actionable insights and guide customers based on their satisfaction.

  <Step title="Feedback Request Text">
    Compose the initial SMS message that invites your customer to provide feedback on their recent experience. Include personalization tokens like `@contact.name` or `@business.name` to make the message feel personal.
