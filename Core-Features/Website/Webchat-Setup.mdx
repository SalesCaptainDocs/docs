## **Chat Window Settings**

From the **Chat Window** tab, you can adjust how the webchat looks and behaves:

- **Customize Appearance:** Edit the chat header text, greeting message, and window colors to match your website’s branding.
- **Departments:** Enable department selection so visitors can choose which team (e.g., Sales, Support, Billing) they want to reach.
- **Form Fields:** Enable or disable form fields (like Name, Email, or Phone), or create your own custom fields.
- **Location Detection:** Automatically pre-select the nearest location based on the visitor’s browser location — useful for multi-location businesses.
- **CAPTCHA:** Enable CAPTCHA to prevent spam submissions.
