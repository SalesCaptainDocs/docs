You can create and manage these triggers by navigating to **Captain Labs → Automations**.

There are **four main types of triggers** you can set up:

## SalesCaptain (SC) Triggers

Internal triggers that respond to activity within your  SalesCaptain account.

1. Go to **Captain Labs → Automations**.
2. Click **New Automation → SC Trigger**.
3. Choose a trigger event (e.g. _New Review Received, Incoming Message, Appointment Canceled, Stage Updated_).
4. Add actions like **Send Email/SMS**, **Assign Conversation**, or **Move to Stage**.

**Note:**

- SC Triggers are **fixed event-based triggers**.
- Each trigger type has its own **keys** depending on the event.

## External Triggers

Start automations from third-party apps integrated with SalesCaptain, such as **DrChrono**, **Clio**, or **Zoho**.

**Example:**

When a new contact is added in Zoho, it syncs with SalesCaptain and sends a welcome SMS.

1. Go to **Captain Labs → Automations → New Automation**.
2. Select **External Trigger**.

Choose the app, map incoming data fields, and add your follow-up actions.

## Webhook Triggers

For custom API connections between systems. Webhooks send or receive data instantly when events occur.

1. Go to **Captain Labs → Automations → New Automation**.
2. Select **Webhook Trigger**.
3. Configure the webhook:
   - **Set Prompt** and **Label Extracted Data**.
   - Copy the **generated URL** and share it with the external system.
4. The trigger and its associated keys will then be displayed on the **Canvas.**
5. Drag and drop the flow controls and actions to build your custom automation flow.

## CSV Upload Triggers

Automate bulk workflows when uploading contact lists or data files.

1. Go to **Captain Labs → Automations → New Automation**.\
   Select **CSV Upload**.
2. Upload a **sample CSV** and **map fields** to SalesCaptain contact data.
3. Save the configuration for quick reuse.
4. Upload new files to trigger automations automatically.

**Example:**

Upload a new customer list → automatically assign to Sales team.

## Use Cases

- **Instant Follow-Ups:** When a lead sends a new message, trigger an automated “We’ll get back to you soon” SMS.
- **Customer Retention:** When a stage is updated to “Lost Lead,” schedule a win-back campaign.
- **Third-Party Sync:** When a new appointment is created in DrChrono, add it to SalesCaptain and notify your team.
- **Custom Web Integrations:** Use webhooks to push form submissions or CRM updates directly into your SalesCaptain Inbox.
- **Bulk Campaigns:** Upload a CSV of customers who made recent purchases and trigger thank-you or review request messages.
