title: "Joining a Workspace"
description: "When your organization adds you to its SalesCaptain workspace, you’ll receive an invitation to join the team. Once you log in with your temporary credentials, you’ll gain access to the Inbox, applications, and features based on your assigned role and permissions."
---

This process ensures that every team member joins securely and with the right level of access.

## How Users Are Added

Admins or owners can invite new users directly from **Settings → Manage Users → All Users**.

To add a new user:

1. Select **Add User**.
2. Enter the user’s **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email Address**, and **Phone Number**.
3. Choose a **Role**: _User_, _Admin_, or _Owner_.
4. Toggle which **applications and inboxes** the user can access.
5. Select **Save** to send the invitation.

Once added, the user automatically receives an email with login details and a temporary password.

## Accepting the Invitation

When you’re invited to join a workspace, you’ll get an email from SalesCaptain with your login information.

1. Open the invitation email and note your **temporary password**.
2. Click the link provided to visit the SalesCaptain login page.
3. Log in using your **email** and the provided **temporary password**.
4. After logging in, you’ll be prompted to **create a new password** for security.

That’s it! You’re now part of your organization’s SalesCaptain workspace.

## Managing Access and Permissions

Your admin can update your access or permissions anytime from **Settings → Manage Users**.

Changes can include:

- Adjusting your role (User, Admin, or Owner)
- Granting or removing access to specific applications
- Modifying which conversations or inboxes you can view

All updates will apply immediately after being saved.

## Best Practices

- Log in using the **email address** you were invited with.
- **Reset your temporary password** immediately after your first login.
- If you don’t receive an invitation, check your **spam** or **promotions** folder.
- Ask your admin to review your permissions if you can’t access a feature you need.
- Keep your login details secure and don’t share them with others.
