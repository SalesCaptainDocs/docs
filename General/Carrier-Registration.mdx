title: "Carrier Registration (A2P 10DLC)"
description: "To ensure your business SMS messages and calls reach their destination without being blocked or filtered, you must complete carrier registration for U.S. numbers. This process verifies your business identity and use case so carriers treat your messages as legitimate."

If you send texts from U.S. numbers through SalesCaptain, completing registration is essential to maintain reliability and deliverability.

## Who Needs to Register

Any workspace that uses U.S. local numbers to send messages must complete registration. This includes both businesses and sole proprietors.

If your numbers are exclusively used for inbound calls or internal messaging, the registration requirement may not apply, but uncertainty risks future blocks or restrictions by carriers.

## How Long It Takes

Typical approval times range from **5 to 7 business days**, but some reviews may extend to **30 days or more** depending on the information provided.

While your application is being reviewed, sending outbound messages to U.S. numbers may be suspended. Monitor the status in your dashboard and plan your communications accordingly.

## Step-by-Step: Business Registration

1. Open your SalesCaptain workspace and navigate to **Settings → Billing → Manage Subscription**.
2. Choose **“Business”** registration if you have an EIN or equivalent business ID.
3. Enter your legal business name, official address, business type, industry, and website or public listing.
4. Describe how you plan to use SMS (e.g., appointment reminders, customer support, marketing updates).
5. Provide at least two sample messages including opt-out instructions (e.g., _“Reply STOP to unsubscribe”_).
6. Upload or link to your privacy policy and consent-collection method (written form, web opt-in, SMS keyword, etc.).
7. Submit your application and pay any one-time or recurring fees required by carriers.
8. Track your status in the Trust/Compliance center until approved.

## Step-by-Step: Sole Proprietor Registration

1. If you don’t have a business ID, select **“Sole Proprietor”** as your registration type.
2. Provide your personal name, valid mobile number (not VoIP), address (U.S. or Canadian), and email.
3. Specify how you’ll use messaging (just like the business path) and submit sample messages with opt-out instructions included.
4. Only one of your numbers may be active for U.S. texting under this path, so plan accordingly.
5. Submission timelines are similar, but the daily or monthly message limits may be lower.
6. Monitor your account status and resubmit if required following any rejection.

## Common Rejection Reasons

- Business name doesn’t match government or tax records.
- Address is incomplete, incorrect or uses a PO Box.
- Message examples are too generic or lack an opt-out statement.
- Consent method is unclear or missing.
- Mobile number used for verification is VoIP or outside the U.S./Canada.
- Registration submitted too soon after obtaining a new business ID (less than 30 days).

## Ongoing Compliance

Once approved:

- Add new numbers to your workspace and they may be covered under your registration (lower fees usually).
- Update business information if it changes: mismatches can impact trust scores.
- Keep documentation of consent methods and sample messaging handy in case of audits.
- Understand that carriers may assign daily or monthly limits based on your registration tier.
