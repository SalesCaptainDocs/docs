title: "Facebook to SalesCaptain"
---

Integrating Facebook Messenger with SalesCaptain allows you to centralize your social media inquiries alongside your other communication channels. This integration syncs your **Facebook Business Page** messages directly to your SalesCaptain inbox.

**Business Accounts Only:** SalesCaptain can only connect to Facebook Business Pages. It is **not possible** to integrate personal Facebook profiles.

## **Requirements**

Before you begin the integration, ensure you have a professional presence on Facebook:

1. **Create a Page:** If you currently only use a personal account, you must create a Facebook Page for your business.
2. **Required Details:** When setting up your page, ensure you provide a **Page Name**, select a relevant **Category**, and include your **Contact Information** and **Website URL**.
3. **Meta Business Account:** Both Facebook and Instagram direct messages can be linked to the same account details, and you will be directed to a facebook login page for both. 

## **Integration Steps**

To link your Facebook Page to the SalesCaptain platform, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** \> **Integrations**.
2. Select **Facebook** from the list of available integrations.
3. Click **Log into your Facebook**.
4. A pop-up will appear requesting permission to access your account. Authenticate using your Facebook credentials.

**Note:** If you have just created your Facebook Business Page, it may take some time to appear in the selection list. If you don't see it immediately, wait a few minutes and refresh the page.

## **Conversation Management**

Facebook integrations utilize a "Temporary Chat" logic to keep your inbox organized and compliant with platform standards.

- **24-hour Window:** Conversations remain active as long as there is ongoing communication.
- **Automatic Closure:** If there is **no communication from either side for 24 consecutive hours**, the conversation will be closed automatically.
- **Conversation History:** You can access past messages under the **Closed** tab in the Unified Inbox.

- That you are an Admin of the page.
- That the page is "Published" and visible to the public.
- That you have granted all requested permissions during the Facebook login prompt.
