title: "Managing Users"
description: "SalesCaptain allows you to manage all Team Members who have access to your workspace. You can add new users, assign roles, control access to conversations and applications, and group people into teams for faster collaboration."
---

These tools make it easy to organize your staff, maintain security, and route conversations efficiently across departments like Sales, Support, or Billing.

## **Team Members**

Naviagate to **Settings → Manage Users **to view all the settings. Only owners have complete permissions and control, and they must be the ones to add and edit additional users.

### **All Users**

The **All Users** tab shows a list of everyone in your workspace. From here, you can:

- **Add new users** by entering their name, email, and phone number.
- **Invite team members** via email or SMS.
- **Edit or archive users** to update details or remove inactive accounts.

Each user’s profile includes role, application access, and notification settings.

### **Editing Roles**

Assign a role to each user based on their level of access:

- **Owner:** Full access to all features, settings, and billing.
- **Admin:** Manage users, conversations, and most settings.
- **User:** Limited access to assigned conversations and enabled apps.

You can also choose what conversations each user can view:

- **Assigned only**
- **Assigned + Unassigned**
- **All conversations**

This helps ensure privacy and keeps focus where it’s needed.

### **Application Access & Notifications**

For each user, you can toggle access to specific applications like Reviews, Payments, or Appointments.\
 Enable or disable **webchat notifications** to control whether a user receives alerts for new incoming chats or messages.

These options allow for granular control over which parts of SalesCaptain each team member can see and use.

### **Editing and Deleting Users**

To edit a user, click their name in the list. You can update their name, contact number, permissions, or access settings.\
 If someone leaves the team, select **Delete** to remove their account, or **Archive** to temporarily disable access without deleting their data.

## **Creating Teams**

Teams help you organize users into groups like **Sales**, **Support**, or **Onboarding**. This makes it easy to route conversations and automate assignments.

### **To create a team:**

1. Go to the **Teams** tab.
2. Select **Create Team**.
3. Enter a name (e.g., _Sales Team_).
4. Choose which users to include.

That’s it! Your team is now active and ready to use across automations, chat flows, and call flows.

You can return at any time to **edit the team** (e.g., add or remove members) or **delete it** entirely. When a workflow is assigned to a team, all members receive the same assignment automatically.

## **Auto-Assign**

The **Auto Assign** feature automatically distributes new conversations among selected users when no specific assignment is set.

1. Open the **Auto Assign** section.
2. Choose the group of users eligible for auto assignment.
3. Toggle **Auto Assign** on or off for each user as needed.

Users are shown in order of seniority, helping you manage how conversations are distributed across the team.

## **Best Practices**

- Keep roles updated as your team grows or responsibilities change.
- Use teams to separate departments for easier automation routing.
- Limit app access to reduce clutter and maintain data security.
- Review notification settings to ensure the right people get alerts.
- Use auto-assign to evenly distribute workload among team members.
