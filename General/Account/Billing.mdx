This ensures your account remains active and up to date, with clear visibility into your balance, usage, and subscription details.

## **Account Balance and Usage**

Under **Settings → Billing**, you can monitor your **available funds** and **current spend** in real time.

Here, you’ll also find your **credit usage metrics** for:

- **Inbox** – messages and conversations
- **Calling** – outbound and inbound calls
- **Text Marketing** – campaign sends and follow-ups

These insights help you track resource usage and plan ahead for upcoming campaigns or call activity.

## **Managing Payments**

### **Upgrade Plan**

Select **Upgrade Plan** to switch to a higher-tier plan or unlock additional features.

Your plan details and rates are displayed so you can easily compare options and adjust based on your business needs.

### **Add Payment Method**

Add or update your **payment method** to ensure seamless billing and uninterrupted service. SalesCaptain supports major credit and debit cards for quick and secure payments.

### **Add Funds**
