To get started, **download the Referrals app from the SalesCaptain Marketplace** before creating or sending referral requests.

### **Creating a Referral Template**

Referral templates define the full customer journey — from the first referral invite to the thank-you message after submission.

You can build templates for [**SMS**](/Core-Features/Marketing/SMS-Templates) or [**Email**](/Core-Features/Marketing/Email-Templates), depending on how you want to reach customers. The overall flow and content sections remain similar across both channels. Navigate to Marketing - Templates to begin building your custom referral request. 

Each template contains the following key parts:

#### **1. General**

Set up the **basic details** of your referral message, including the subject line (for email) and your business signature or closing line. This ensures all referral requests reflect your brand tone and identity.

#### **2. Referral Request Text**

Create your **invite message** that encourages existing customers to refer their friends.

- For **SMS**, this is the message that appears in their text thread.
- For **Email**, it appears as the body content of your referral email.

Keep it friendly, clear, and incentive-based (e.g., “Share and earn ₹500 off your next service!”).

#### **3. Referral Page**

When customers click the referral link in your text or email, they’re taken to your **Referral Page** — a branded landing page that automatically generates a **unique, shareable referral link**.

Customers can share this link via **SMS** or **Email**, depending on their preferred method.

#### **4. Referral Form**

This is where referred friends provide their contact details so your team can follow up.

There are two formats, depending on how the referral was sent:

- **Text Referral Form:** A mobile-friendly form for referrals coming through SMS.
- **Email Referral Form:** A desktop-optimized version for email referrals.

Both forms capture the essential information — typically the referred person’s name, phone number, and email address.

#### **5. Thank You Page**

After a referral is submitted, the **Thank You Page** confirms that the referral has been received. You can customize this page with a short appreciation note, next steps, or incentive details.

### **Tracking Referral Activity**

Once you start sending or receiving referrals, everything appears under the **Referrals tab** in your SalesCaptain dashboard. You can monitor all referral progress across three main categories:

- **Sent** – Referral messages or links shared with your customers.
- **Shared** – Instances where customers have forwarded or shared their unique referral links.
- **Received** – New leads or customers who completed the referral form.

### **Sending Referral Requests**

After your template is ready:

1. Open any conversation in your Inbox.
2. Click the \*\*Templates option in the message composer.
3. Choose your referral template and select whether to send it via **text** or **email**.

💡 _Tip: Always make sure the Referrals app is installed before sending referral requests—this ensures proper tracking in the Referrals tab._

### **Best Practices & Tips**

- Use clear language and short forms. A simple message and one-step referral flow convert better than complex offers.
- Encourage participation by rewarding both the referrer and the referred customer — even small rewards create motivation to share.
- Try sending a few referral requests via SMS and a few via Email to see which performs better with your audience.
- Review the **Referrals tab** regularly to identify top-performing templates or reward offers and refine your approach over time.
