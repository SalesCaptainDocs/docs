### **How It Works**

Each team member earns points based on their activity; namely, sending a review request or collecting a new customer review. These points contribute to their overall score on the leaderboard, allowing you to celebrate top performers and encourage friendly competition.

### **Configuration**

Set up your leaderboard by defining roles, assigning points, and connecting users.

1. **Create designations:** Add team roles and assign point values (e.g., _Front Desk – 2 points per request, 10 points per review_).

2. **Map users to designations:** Assign each user to their role (e.g., _Ryan → Front Desk_).
3. **Select reward options:** Choose gift card types or incentives to recognize top performers.

**Pro tip:** Define clear and balanced point values to keep competition fair and motivating.
