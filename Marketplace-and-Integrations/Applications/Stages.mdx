You can create and sort contacts into different stages such as **Leads**, **Customers**, **Tech Issues**, or any custom category that fits your workflow.

To get started, **download the Stages app from the SalesCaptain Marketplace** and enable it in your workspace.

## **Using Stages in the Inbox**

Once enabled, you’ll see a **Stages sidebar** in your Inbox.

- Simply **drag and drop conversations** into a specific stage to categorize them.
- You can move conversations between stages anytime as their status changes.
- This view helps your team stay organized and ensures that every contact is in the right stage of your customer journey.

## **Managing Stages**

Go to the **Stages tab** in your sidebar to see a complete overview of all contacts grouped by stage. From here, you can:

- **View** and manage the list of contacts in each stage.
- **Mark contacts as completed** once a stage is finished—completed contacts are automatically removed from active stages.
- **Edit contact details** or **mark conversations as spam** directly within the Stages tab.
- **Filter contacts** based on the assigned team member.
- **View up to two custom fields** for each contact right in the Stages view for quick context.
- **Reorder contacts or move them** between stages with a simple drag and drop action.

## Automations with Stages 

In **Captain Labs**, you can set up automations that trigger based on stage changes.\
For example:

- Automatically notify a team member when a a contact is added to the “Customer” stage.
- Send a follow-up email when a contact is marked as “Completed.”
- Create workflows to update CRM fields or trigger integrations when stages change.

These automations help you streamline your follow-ups and ensure no lead or customer slips through the cracks. Visit our Automations guide for more information.
