**Example:** Share a session link for “Yoga Classes” or “Doctor Appointments” so clients can directly book from the list of pre-scheduled time slots.

**Pro tip:** Update session availability ahead of time to keep bookings consistent and avoid conflicts.

- **Use clear names and descriptions:** Make it easy for customers to understand what each appointment or session offers.
- **Automate smartly:** Enable auto-completion and waitlists to save manual tracking effort.
- **Share booking links widely:** Add session links to your website, social pages, or emails to boost visibility.
- **Review analytics often:** Use appointment data to identify popular time slots, top-performing providers, or areas to optimize scheduling.
