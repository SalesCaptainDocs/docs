### **Sending Payment Requests**

Once your payment gateway is connected:

1. Navigate to the **Inbox**.
2. Open a conversation with the customer.
3. Click the **Payment icon** in the message composer.
4. Choose whether to send a **Payment Request** or **Charge a Card Directly**.

#### **Payment Requests**

- Choose to send the request via **Text (SMS)** or **Email**.
- You can accept payments through **credit card**, **bank transfer**, or **customer’s preferred method**.
- If you’ve enabled **surcharges**, credit card processing fees will automatically be passed on to the customer.

#### **Direct Charges**

- Use the **Charge Amount** option to directly bill a customer’s card.
- Enter the customer’s details and the exact amount to be charged.

### **Managing Transactions**

All transactions can be tracked in the **Transactions tab** of the Payments app.\
From here, you can:

- **View transaction history** across all payment gateways.
- **Cancel**, **view**, or **resend** payment links.
- **Download invoices** once transactions are successful.

### **Subscriptions and Payouts**

- The **Subscriptions tab** is available exclusively for **Stripe** integrations, allowing you to create and manage recurring payments.
- The **Payouts tab** helps you track transfers and settlement details from your connected payment processors.

### **Best Practices & Tips**

- Before sending your first payment request, double-check that your gateway (Helcim, Stripe, or Authorize.net) is correctly connected and verified.
- When sending a request, include a short description (e.g., “Deposit for Project A” or “October Service Fee”) to make it easy for customers to recognize the payment purpose.
- If you decide to pass on card processing fees, make sure your customers are informed upfront to avoid confusion.
- Use the **Transactions tab** to quickly identify failed or pending payments and follow up with customers right from the Inbox.
