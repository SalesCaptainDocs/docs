description: "Welcome to the SalesCaptain API Reference — your gateway to integrating powerful CRM, automation, and lead management features directly into your applications."
---

Our APIs are designed for developers to seamlessly access SalesCaptain’s suite of tools, including lead capture, customer communication, analytics, and campaign automation.

<Note>
  Tip: Use this API documentation to explore, test, and integrate SalesCaptain features into your platform efficiently.
</Note>

There are two primary ways to use our API:

- **OpenAPI Specification** — for direct endpoint testing and integration.
- **MDX Components** — for interactive documentation and embedded code examples.

## Authentication

All API requests to SalesCaptain are authenticated using **Bearer tokens**.\
To access our endpoints:

1. Generate your API key from your **SalesCaptain Developer Dashboard**.
2. Include the token in the header of every request as shown below.

Or, as a raw HTTP header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

OpenAPI Security Block:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

## Company Management

The Companies API allows you to fetch all companies linked to the authenticated user.

This includes:

- Company IDs
- Company names
- Relationship based on accounts
- Permission-bound access

<Note>
  You can filter leads by date, status, or source using query parameters.

### **GET /v1 — Health Check**

The Health Check endpoint allows developers and monitoring systems to verify that the **SalesCaptain API Documentation Service** is running correctly.\
It returns the current service version, uptime status, and ensures that the gateway is responsive before making further API calls.

This is especially useful for:

- Automated monitoring systems
- CI/CD pipelines
- Internal dashboards
- Integration testing

### **What It Does**

- Confirms that the API is reachable
- Returns the current API version
- Helps prevent unnecessary requests if the service is down

### Response Example

```
{
  "message": "SalesCaptain API [Service version - 0.1]"
}
```

### **GET /v1/fetch-companies — Fetch Companies**

This endpoint retrieves all companies associated with the authenticated user.\
SalesCaptain users often manage multiple accounts/locations, and each account is linked to a company.\
This API collects all those company records and returns them in a clean, structured format.

### **What This Endpoint Does**

- Authenticates the request using the user’s Bearer token
- Identifies which accounts the user belongs to
- Extracts the company IDs from those accounts
- Fetches full company details
- Returns all companies the user has access to

### **Example Use Cases**

- Building a dashboard showing all organizations the user manages
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications pulling business profiles
- CRM systems syncing company metadata
- Showing users a list of their locations or franchises

### **Response Example**

```
{
  "message": "Companies fetched successfully!",
  "companies": [
    {
      "company_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "name": "salescaptain"
    }
  ]
}
```
