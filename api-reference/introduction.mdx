There are two primary ways to use our API:

- **OpenAPI Specification** — for direct endpoint testing and integration.
- **MDX Components** — for interactive documentation and embedded code examples.

## Authentication

All API requests to SalesCaptain are authenticated using **Bearer tokens**.\
To access our endpoints:

1. Generate your API key from your **SalesCaptain Developer Dashboard**.
2. Include the token in the header of every request as shown below.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

## **Lead Management**

Use the Lead API to create, fetch, and manage leads from any source — website forms, campaigns, or integrations.

### **Endpoints**

- `GET /leads` — Retrieve all leads
- `POST /leads` — Create a new lead
- `GET /leads/{id}` — Get lead details by ID
- `PATCH /leads/{id}` — Update lead details
- `DELETE /leads/{id}` — Delete a lead

Example response:

  "id": "12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
